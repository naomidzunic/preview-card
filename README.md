## My process

Okay this one initially was a doozy since I was adding stuff into the project. Still working on it for now but we're going to make progress in order tomake sure to commit often.

This is also the first real project with a mobile responsive design. So buckle up. Strategy is to make it mostly mobile responsive first then working backwards. Let's see how that works out. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (attempted)

### What I learned

I will say, this was really tough. At first I was pretty confident going into everything, starting out with mobile first and then desktop, but then things started to get really messy. I got really stuck with alignment as well as the device reponsiveness and it was to the point where it was way to messy and confusing even for me. I ended up reviewing other submissions and see where I went wrong, including a video walkthrough and realized the following: 

1. Styling is much more simple than one thinks - In some ways I was able to customize what I needed but in other ways I didn't need to add a lot of the div classes that I originally had. 

2. Put everything on the site first before you even think about styling. I think at one point I was trying to do both desktop and mobile versions and it was super confusing. I've learned it's best to get everything on the site FIRST and then go into styling. If your stuff is on the site and then responsive without styling then everything will follow. 

I know that practice is really going to help a lot. I know I have plenty of things to learn when it comes to alignment and device responsiveness but after this practice, knowing that I did it (even while I was super confused) the only way I can go from here is up.
